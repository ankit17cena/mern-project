# MERN App

This is a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack application that demonstrates authentication, file upload, and data display functionalities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js**: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **MongoDB**: [Download MongoDB Community Server](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) and ensure it's running.

### Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mern-app.git
   cd mern-app
   ```

2. **Backend Setup**

   Navigate to the `backend` directory and install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following content:

   ```plaintext
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/mern-app
   PORT=5000
   JWT_SECRET=jwt_secret_key
   ```

   Replace `jwt_secret_key` with a secure key. You can generate one using the following Node.js script:

   ```js
   const crypto = require('crypto');
   console.log(crypto.randomBytes(64).toString('hex'));
   ```

   Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The backend server will be available at [http://localhost:5000].

3. **Frontend Setup**

   Navigate to the `frontend` directory and install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

   Start the frontend development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The frontend application will be available at [http://localhost:3000].

## Running the Application

1. **Ensure MongoDB is Running**

   Make sure your MongoDB server is up and running. By default, it should be accessible at `mongodb://localhost:27017`.

2. **Start the Backend Server**

   Run the backend server using:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Start the Frontend Server**

   Run the frontend server using:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Access the Application**

   Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000] to use the application.

## Usage

1. **Register a New User**

   Navigate to the registration page at [http://localhost:3000/register].
   - Enter your name, email, and password.
   - Click "Register" to create a new account.

2. **Log In**

   Go to the login page at [http://localhost:3000/].
   - Enter your email and password.
   - Click "Login" to access the dashboard.

3. **Upload a File**

   Once logged in, go to the dashboard at [http://localhost:3000/dashboard].
   - Choose a file using the file input.
   - Click "Upload" to upload the file and view its content.

## Troubleshooting

- **Backend Not Starting**: Ensure MongoDB is running and verify the connection URI in the `.env` file.
- **Frontend Not Displaying**: Check for console errors in the browser and confirm that the backend server is running.
- **File Upload Issues**: Ensure that the file is correctly selected and that the backend API endpoint for file uploads is functioning.
